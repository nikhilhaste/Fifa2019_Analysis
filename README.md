# FIFA 19 dataset - player's market value and game position prediction

In this work we aimed to predict a football player's value and their game position on the FIFA 19 dataset which is publicly available on kaggle. We did complete data analysis of player's data which was followed by data preprocessing and then by training the model. We tried to use only the player's skill-based attributes (finishing, sprint speed, heading...) and physical attributes (age, height, weight...) in our models.
